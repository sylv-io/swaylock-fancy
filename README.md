        -g, --greyscale  Set background to greyscale instead of color.

        -p, --pixelate   Pixelate the background instead of blur, runs faster.

                         Note: this option will not lock the screen, it displays

To use this script you can set a hotkey in your window manager to run the lock
command. This is what it would look like in your sway config:
```
    exec swayidle -w \
        timeout 300 'swaylock-fancy' \
        timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' \
            resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
        before-sleep 'swaylock-fancy'
```
